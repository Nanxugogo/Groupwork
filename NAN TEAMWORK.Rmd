## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r nan1}
###upload data###
income_aggregate <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-02-09/income_aggregate.csv')
```
```{r nan2}
###check race count###
count(income_aggregate,race)
```
```{r nan3}
###check quintile count###
count(income_aggregate,income_quintile)

```

```{r nan4}
#####pretreatment for this dataset###
df1 <- income_aggregate %>% na.omit() %>% 
  subset(year>=2000 & income_quintile!="Top 5%")
count(df1,income_quintile)
#####reorder income_quintile###
df1$income_quintile=factor(df1$income_quintile,c("Highest","Second","Third","Forth","Lowest"))
```
```{r nan5}
#####ggplot###
ggplot(df1,aes(year,income_share,color=income_quintile))+
  geom_line(linewidth=0.5)+facet_grid(.~race)+
  labs(title = "The income share of different races in 21th century ", xlab="Year",ylab="Income share",color="Classification")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2000,2010,2019))+theme_bw()

```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
